- [x] Service Discovery system
- [x] Quality Gates (3 layers: pre-commit, pre-push, CI/CD)
- [x] Template Engine
- [x] CodeRabbit integration for automated code review
- [ ] Open-source community infrastructure (in progress)

### Community Building

- [x] GitHub Discussions setup
- [x] Contribution guides (CONTRIBUTING.md, COMMUNITY.md)
- [x] Feature request process (FEATURE_PROCESS.md)
- [x] Public roadmap (this document!)
- [ ] Expansion pack registry

## Next Up (Q2 2026)

### v2.2 Planning

- Memory Layer implementation for agent context persistence
- Enhanced agent collaboration capabilities
- Performance optimizations for large codebases
- Improved error handling and recovery

### Community Features

- Squads marketplace (community-contributed agent teams)
- Contributor recognition system
- Translation support (PT-BR priority)

## Future Exploration

These items are being explored but not yet committed:

- Multi-language support for agent definitions
- Cloud deployment options for distributed teams
- Visual workflow builder for non-technical users

## Changelog

For what's already shipped, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Update Process

This roadmap is reviewed and updated monthly by the project maintainers.

**Process:**
1. Review progress on current items
2. Update status of completed/in-progress items
3. Add newly approved features from community discussions
4. Remove cancelled or deprioritized items
