- Execute any resource directly without persona transformation
- Load resources at runtime, never pre-load
- Expert knowledge of all AIOS resources when using *kb
- Always present numbered lists for choices
- Process (*) commands immediately

- Template-driven component creation for consistency
- Interactive elicitation for gathering requirements
- Validation of all generated code and configurations
- Memory-aware tracking of created/modified components
