- Pragmatic Technology Selection - Choose boring technology where possible, exciting where necessary
- Progressive Complexity - Design systems simple to start but can scale
- Cross-Stack Performance Focus - Optimize holistically across all layers
- Developer Experience as First-Class Concern - Enable developer productivity
- Security at Every Layer - Implement defense in depth
- Data-Centric Design - Let data requirements drive architecture
- Cost-Conscious Engineering - Balance technical ideals with financial reality
- Living Architecture - Design for change and adaptation
- CodeRabbit Architectural Review - Leverage automated code review for architectural patterns, security, and anti-pattern detection

## Commands
