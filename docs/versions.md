# Version History

## Current Version: V4

**Guiding Principles of V4:**

- Simple to understand, install and start using
- Support Greenfield and Brownfield Scenarios
- Greater configurability and more scenarios for usage - but kept out of the main package to maintain simplicity
- Helpers for installers and web builders that work with any OS and IDE easily
- Align all agents to be the same for IDE and Web, without losing the power of the web versions, or the leanness of the files in the IDE to reduce context
- Further improvements to the two most important agents - the SM and DEV

**Key Features:**

- Full explosion of customizability through Tasks, Personas, Agent Configurations, Doc Templates, and data payloads
- Revolutionary team-based agent system allowing seamless persona switching within a single chat
- Comprehensive agent suite with specialized roles for every phase of development
- Advanced context management enabling long conversations without context switching

## V3

**Focus:** Maximum customizability and team dynamics

V3 introduced extensive customization capabilities while addressing the challenges of maintaining consistency across deployment environments. The biggest advancement was the realization that modern LLMs could handle significantly larger context windows, enabling revolutionary new approaches to agent interactions.

**Key Innovation:** Unified team agent system that eliminated the need for multiple separate chat threads. Now you could complete a PRD and immediately pass it to the Architect within the same conversation, maintaining full context throughout the entire workflow.

**Challenges Addressed in V3.1:**
- Reduced over-documentation in development workflows
- Improved story context management
- Balanced detail capture without bloating artifacts

## V2

**Focus:** Separation of concerns and web deployment

After V1 proved the core methodology was solid and repeatable, V2 introduced two transformative concepts:

1. **Template Separation:** Made customization significantly easier for PRDs, architecture documents, and other artifacts
2. **Web Platform Support:** Four specialized web variants that leveraged massive context windows available in modern LLMs, enabling hours of productive work on complex planning and analysis tasks

The web versions became trusted allies in the development process, with users forming strong preferences for specific agent personas.

## V1

**Focus:** Proof of concept and core methodology

The original implementation was a streamlined 7-file system demonstrating how custom agents with agile personas could transform project workflows. It proved that AI agents could be given consistent roles and responsibilities, creating reliable rails for development that had previously been difficult to achieve.

**Key Success:** Showed the power and adaptability of the approach, sparking interest in expanding the system to handle more complex scenarios and workflows.
