# AIOS 4.0.4 - Objective Differentiation Plan

Date: 2026-02-16
Status: Active

## Strategic Principle

Differentiate AIOS without copying BMAD, with learning-curve reduction as the top priority.

## Workstreams

0. Learning curve first (P0)
1. Runtime-first (Flow State Engine)
2. Compatibility Contract by IDE/release
3. Assisted autonomy with risk profiles
4. Structured inter-agent handoffs
5. Delivery Confidence Score
6. Vertical specialization (data-engineer, devops, squad-creator)
7. Brownfield as premium capability
8. Native agent-flow observability
9. Live ADR as executable contract
10. AIOS-first terminology

## Wave Plan

### Wave 0 (P0)
- Learning curve reduction.
- Single onboarding path and first-value <=10 min.

### Wave 1
- Flow-state runtime guidance.
- Compatibility contract and parity blocking.
- Risk-based execution profiles.

### Wave 2
- Structured handoffs.
- Delivery confidence score.
- Agent decision timeline observability.

### Wave 3
- Vertical specialization clarity and public examples.
- Brownfield premium track with rollback strategy.
- Live ADR validations.
- Terminology hardening and semantic lint.

## Delivery Rules

- No public claim without corresponding validation.
- No safety profile without explicit policy and audit log.
- No handoff without snapshot, decision log, evidence links, and open risks.
