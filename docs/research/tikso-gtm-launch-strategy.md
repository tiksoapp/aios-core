## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

Brazil's beauty and grooming market is valued at ~US$40 billion (projected 2027), growing at 7.2% annually. In 2025 alone, 235,000+ new beauty businesses opened. The barbershop segment specifically grew 16% in new business openings. Yet the CRM adoption rate among these small businesses is extremely low -- most still manage clients via personal WhatsApp, paper notebooks, or basic spreadsheets.

### Tikso's Unique Position

Tikso is not competing with Trinks, Avec, or Gendo on scheduling. Tikso occupies a fundamentally different category: **AI-powered conversational CRM native to WhatsApp**. The differentiator is Eli, the AI assistant that handles client communication autonomously 24/7. No competitor in the Brazilian micro-business space offers this combination.

| Competitor | Core Value | WhatsApp Native | AI Conversational | CRM Pipeline |
|------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Trinks | Scheduling + management | No (web-based) | No | Basic |
| Avec | Scheduling + marketplace | No (app-based) | No | No |
| Gendo | Scheduling + finance | No (web-based) | No | Basic |
| Kommo | CRM + WhatsApp | Yes (API) | Basic chatbot | Yes |
| **Tikso** | **AI CRM + WhatsApp** | **Yes (Evolution API)** | **Yes (Eli AI)** | **Yes** |

### Strategic Auto-Decisions

```
[AUTO-DECISION] Primary platform? -> Meta (Instagram + Facebook)
  (reason: Target audience -- local business owners -- lives on Instagram.
   Discovery happens there. WhatsApp is the conversion channel, not discovery.)

[AUTO-DECISION] Primary objective? -> Lead Generation
  (reason: SaaS product needs qualified demos/trials, not direct purchase.
   The sale requires education about AI capabilities.)

[AUTO-DECISION] Market? -> Brasil only (Fase 0-2)
  (reason: Product is Portuguese-only, Evolution API is BR-focused,
   WhatsApp dominance is a Brazil-specific advantage.)

[AUTO-DECISION] Pricing model assumption? -> R$197-397/month SaaS
  (reason: Must be above commodity scheduling tools (R$49-99) to reflect
   AI value, but below enterprise CRM (R$500+) to fit SMB budgets.
   Recommended tiers: Starter R$197, Pro R$297, Business R$397.)
```

## Launch Strategy (3 Phases)

### PHASE 0: Beta Fechado (10 businesses) -- Months 1-2

**Objective:** Validate product-market fit, collect case studies, fix bugs in production.

**Framework:** @molly-pittman Traffic Engine Step 1 (Customer Avatar) + Step 2 (Before & After Grid)

#### Selection Criteria for Beta Partners

| Criterion | Why It Matters | Minimum |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| WhatsApp volume | Tests Eli under real load | 50+ client messages/day |
| Digital presence | Can provide testimonials/content | Active Instagram |
| Revenue | Can afford to pay post-beta | R$15K+/month |
| Geographic diversity | Validate across regions | 3+ cities |
| Vertical diversity | Validate across segments | 3+ segments |

#### How to Select the 10 Beta Partners

1. **Start from Trimmo (existing pilot)** -- Extract data: messages handled, appointments booked, revenue impact. This becomes the anchor case study.

2. **Warm network outreach (5 spots):**
   - Ask Trimmo owner for 2-3 referrals (barbershop owners they know)
   - Reach out to BestBarbers network (already integrated) for 2-3 high-volume shops
   - Personal network: any barbershop/salon owner contacts

3. **Cold-warm outreach via Instagram (4 spots):**
   - Search hashtags: #barbearia, #barbeariabrasileira, #salaobeleza, #clinicaestetica
   - Target accounts with 1K-10K followers (active, engaged owners)
   - DM script (see below)

#### Beta DM Outreach Script (Instagram)

```

```

#### Beta Success Metrics

|--------|--------|--------------|
| Eli response accuracy | >85% | Manual audit of 100 conversations |
| Appointments booked by AI | >20/week per business | Dashboard tracking |
| Client satisfaction (NPS from beta) | >40 | Survey to business owners |
| Time saved per owner | >2h/day | Before/after self-report |
| Bug reports | <5 critical in 30 days | Support tickets |

---

### PHASE 1: Soft Launch (50 businesses) -- Months 3-5

**Objective:** Establish repeatable acquisition model, find CAC, validate ROAS.

**Framework:** @molly-pittman Traffic Engine Steps 3-6 (Traffic Temperature, Offer, Ad Copy, Targeting)

#### Launch Event Strategy

**"Semana da IA no Seu Negocio" -- Online Event (5 days)**

| Day | Theme | Format | CTA |
|-----|-------|--------|-----|
| Day 1 | "Por que seus clientes somem" | Instagram Live + Reels | Follow + save |
| Day 2 | "WhatsApp: seu melhor vendedor (se souber usar)" | Carrossel educativo | Comment "EU QUERO" |
| Day 3 | "Eli em acao: demo ao vivo com barbearia real" | Live demo (Trimmo) | Link na bio |
| Day 4 | "Quanto tempo voce perde respondendo WhatsApp?" | Stories interativos | DM para demo |
| Day 5 | "Oferta de lancamento (30 primeiros)" | Live de vendas | Link de checkout |

#### Acquisition Channels for Phase 1

| Channel | Target Leads | CAC Estimate | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Referral (beta users) | 15 | R$0-50 | P0 |
| Instagram organic (Reels + DM) | 10 | R$0 (time cost) | P0 |
| Meta Ads (lead gen) | 15 | R$80-150 | P1 |
| WhatsApp community | 5 | R$0 | P1 |
| BestBarbers partnership | 5 | Revenue share | P1 |

#### Conversion Flow (Phase 1)

```
Instagram/Ad -> Landing Page -> WhatsApp Demo (with Eli herself!)
                                      |
                              Eli qualifies lead
                              Eli books demo call
                              Human closes on call
                                      |
                              14-day free trial
                                      |
                              Onboarding + payment
```

The key insight: **Use Eli (the product) as the sales tool.** When a lead clicks "Falar com a Tikso," Eli responds. The lead experiences the product value before any human interaction. This is the most powerful demo possible.

---

### PHASE 2: Scale (200+ businesses) -- Months 6-12

**Objective:** Automate acquisition, activate growth loops, reduce CAC below R$150.

**Framework:** @ralph-burns Creative Lab + DPI2 for scaling, @pedro-sobral Metodologia ABC for Brazil operations

#### Growth Loops to Activate

**Loop 1: Product-Led Growth (PLG)**
```
Client uses Tikso -> Client's customers interact with Eli
-> Customer receives message: "Atendimento por Tikso.com.br"
-> Customer is also a business owner
-> Customer signs up for Tikso
```
- Mechanism: "Powered by Tikso" subtle branding on Eli messages (free tier)
- Expected contribution: 10-15% of new leads

**Loop 2: Referral Loop**
```
Client refers another business owner
-> Referred business signs up
-> Both get 1 month free
-> Referred business refers again
```
- K-factor target: 0.3 (every 10 clients bring 3 new ones)
- Expected contribution: 20-30% of new leads

**Loop 3: Content Flywheel**
```
Tikso produces educational content
-> Content ranks on Google/YouTube
-> Business owners discover Tikso
-> They sign up and generate success stories
-> Success stories become new content
```
- Time to maturity: 6-9 months
- Expected contribution: 15-25% of new leads (growing over time)

**Loop 4: Community Loop**
```
Client joins WhatsApp community
-> Gets value from tips/networking
-> Invites other business owners
-> Community grows
-> New members discover Tikso
```
- Expected contribution: 10-15% of new leads

#### Phase 2 Channel Mix (Monthly)

| Channel | Budget/Effort | Expected Leads | Expected Customers | CAC |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-----|
| Meta Ads | R$3,000-5,000 | 60-100 | 8-15 | R$200-350 |

## Channel Acquisition Priorities

### Ranked by CAC (Lowest to Highest)

| Priority | Channel | CAC | Time to Result | Scalability | Phase |
|----------|---------|-----|---------------|-------------|-------|
| P0 | Referral program | R$50-100 | Immediate | Medium | 0-2 |
| P0 | Product-led ("Powered by Tikso") | R$0 | Slow (3-6 months) | High | 1-2 |
| P1 | Instagram organic (Reels) | R$0 (time) | 2-4 weeks | Medium | 0-2 |
| P1 | WhatsApp community | R$0 (time) | 4-8 weeks | Low-Medium | 0-2 |
| P2 | Partnerships (BestBarbers, suppliers) | R$100-200 | 4-8 weeks | Medium | 1-2 |
| P2 | SEO / Blog content | R$0 (time) | 3-6 months | High | 1-2 |
| P3 | Meta Ads (Instagram + Facebook) | R$150-350 | 1-2 weeks | High | 1-2 |
| P3 | Google Ads (Search) | R$250-400 | 1-2 weeks | High | 2 |
| P4 | YouTube content | R$0 (time) | 3-6 months | High | 1-2 |
| P5 | Outbound (direct DM/cold call) | R$200-400 | Immediate | Low | 0-1 |

### Channel Deep-Dive: Why Instagram Organic is P0

For local service businesses in Brazil, **Instagram is the discovery platform**. Business owners:
- Scroll Instagram for inspiration (haircut styles, salon decor, business tips)
- Follow other barbershop/salon owners
- Discover tools through Reels showing results
- Trust DM conversations more than website forms

The winning format is **"before/after" Reels** showing:
- Before: Owner overwhelmed with WhatsApp notifications
- After: Eli handling everything, owner focused on cutting hair

| Demo via Eli (WhatsApp) | Chat with AI, see it work | Demo completion rate | >60% |
| Live demo call (human) | 15-min screen share | Show rate | >50% |

Vi que voce quer saber como automatizar o WhatsApp do seu
[TIPO_NEGOCIO]. Posso te mostrar agora mesmo -- e so me
mandar 'QUERO VER' que eu faco uma demo ao vivo aqui."

Day 1: [Video] Case study do Trimmo: "O [OWNER] da Trimmo

no WhatsApp. [X]% dos saloes que testam renovam.

### BOFU (Bottom of Funnel) -- Conversion

**How we close:**

|------|--------|-------|------|
| 1 | Lead completes demo via Eli | Automated | Tikso/Eli |
| 2 | Eli qualifies (revenue, team size, WhatsApp volume) | Automated | Tikso/Eli |
| 3 | Qualified lead gets trial activated | Automated | System |
| 4 | Onboarding call (setup Eli for their business) | Human | Google Meet |

| 7 | Payment link sent (PIX, credit card) | Automated | Payment system |

**Conversion Optimization Levers:**

- **PIX discount:** 10% off for annual payment via PIX (reduces churn, improves cash flow)
- **Urgency:** "30 vagas na sua cidade" (geographic scarcity)
- **Social proof:** "42 barbearias na sua regiao ja usam Tikso" (after Phase 2)
- **Risk reversal:** "30 dias de garantia. Se a Eli nao agendar pelo menos 20 clientes, devolvemos tudo."

Mas quem responde o WhatsApp?"

```

### Landing Page Strategy

**Primary LP: tikso.com.br (or /demo)**

| Section | Content | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Hero | "Sua IA que responde WhatsApp 24h" + Demo video (30 sec) + CTA | Immediate value prop |
| Social proof | Logos/testimonials from beta clients | Trust |
| Problem | "3h por dia respondendo WhatsApp" infographic | Pain amplification |
| Solution | How Eli works (3 steps: Conecta, Responde, Agenda) | Clarity |
| Demo | Embedded WhatsApp widget (talk to Eli live) | Product experience |
| Pricing | 3 tiers with "14 dias gratis" badge | Conversion |
| FAQ | 6-8 common objections answered | Objection handling |
| Final CTA | "Comece em 5 minutos" + WhatsApp link | Close |

**Key LP Optimization Rules:**

- Mobile-first (90%+ of traffic will be mobile in Brazil)
- Page load under 3 seconds (use Cloudflare CDN)
- WhatsApp CTA button fixed at bottom of screen (floating)
- PIX payment option prominently displayed
- No form required -- all conversion via WhatsApp (reduces friction)

### Retargeting Setup

| Audience | Trigger | Ad | Frequency |
|----------|---------|-----|-----------|
| LP visitors (no conversion) | Visited LP, did not click WhatsApp | Ad 3 (social proof) | 1x/day, 7 days |
| Video viewers (50%+) | Watched ad video halfway | Ad 5 (click-to-WhatsApp) | 1x/day, 5 days |
| WhatsApp clickers (no demo) | Clicked CTA, no conversation | Ad 1 (main video) | 1x/day, 3 days |
| Trial users (not converted) | Started trial, no payment | Ad 3 (results) + urgency | 1x/day, 3 days |

---

## Referral Program Design

### Framework Applied: @molly-pittman Traffic Engine Step 9 (Optimization & Scaling)

### Program Structure: "Indique e Ganhe"

**Mechanism:**
```
Active client generates unique referral link/code
-> Shares with business owner friends
-> Friend signs up and starts paid plan
-> BOTH get reward
```

### Incentive Structure

| Action | Referrer Gets | Referred Gets |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Friend starts free trial | Nothing (yet) | 14 days free |
| Friend converts to paid (month 1) | 1 month free | 1 month at 50% off |
| Friend stays 3+ months | R$100 credit | Nothing extra |
| 3rd referral converts | Upgrade to next tier free for 1 month | Same as above |

**Why this structure works:**
- No cost until actual conversion (performance-based)
- Reward both sides (reduces friction in asking)
- Escalating rewards incentivize multiple referrals
- Credit (not cash) keeps revenue in the ecosystem

### Mechanics

**Sharing:**
- Unique code per client (e.g., TRIMMO2026)
- Shareable link: tikso.com.br/r/TRIMMO2026
- WhatsApp share button inside Tikso dashboard
- Pre-written message template for easy sharing:

```
"Oi [NOME]! Comecei a usar o Tikso no meu [NEGOCIO]
e a IA deles responde meus clientes no WhatsApp 24h.
To amando. Se quiser testar, usa meu codigo [CODE]
e ganha 14 dias gratis: tikso.com.br/r/[CODE]"
```

**Tracking:**
- Referral code stored in UTM parameter and WhatsApp conversation
- Attribution window: 30 days from first click
- Dashboard showing: referrals sent, trials started, conversions, credits earned

### Projected Impact

| Month | Active Referrers | Referrals Sent | Trial Starts | Conversions | Credit Cost |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 3 | 10 | 20 | 8 | 3 | R$891 |
| 6 | 30 | 75 | 30 | 12 | R$3,564 |
| 12 | 80 | 240 | 96 | 38 | R$11,286 |

**K-factor target: 0.3** (every 10 clients produce 3 new clients per quarter)

---

## Partnerships Strategy

### 1. BestBarbers (Already Integrated)

**Current State:** Technical integration exists (Tikso connects with BestBarbers scheduling).

**Leverage Strategy:**

| Action | Timeline | Expected Impact |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Joint case study (Trimmo using both) | Month 1 | Credibility for both |
| Co-branded landing page | Month 2 | Lead sharing |
| BestBarbers recommends Tikso to clients without CRM | Month 3 | 5-10 leads/month |
| Revenue share: BestBarbers gets 15% of month 1 for referrals | Month 3 | Incentive alignment |
| Joint webinar: "Agenda + IA: o combo perfeito" | Month 4 | 50-100 leads |

**Pitch to BestBarbers:**
```
"Seus clientes ja usam agenda online. Mas quem responde o
WhatsApp deles? Tikso complementa o BestBarbers -- nao
compete. Seu cliente que usa ambos tem [X]% mais agendamentos.
Vamos fazer um revenue share: voce indica, ganha 15% do
primeiro mes de cada cliente que converter."
```

### Quick Decision Frameworks

**When to kill an ad:**
- CPL > 2x target for 3+ days with 1,000+ impressions
- CTR < 0.8% after 5,000 impressions
- Frequency > 3.0 on cold audience
- No conversions after R$200 spent

**When to scale an ad:**
- CPL < target for 3+ days with consistent volume
- CTR > 2% on cold audience
- ROAS > 2:1 on conversions
- Scale by 20% every 3 days (never more than 20%)

**When to refresh creative:**
- CTR drops 30% from peak
- CPL increases 50% from baseline
- Frequency > 2.5 on cold audience
- Creative running for 3+ weeks unchanged

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|

## Key Strategic Principles

1. **Product IS the sales pitch.** Every interaction with Eli is a demo. Make the first WhatsApp message from Eli the best sales experience possible.

2. **Organic before paid.** With a small budget, organic content and referrals must carry Phases 0-1. Paid ads amplify what already works organically.

3. **Vertical focus before horizontal expansion.** Own "barbershop AI CRM" first. Then expand to salons, clinics, gyms. Do not spread thin.

4. **WhatsApp is the funnel.** In Brazil, the website is a waypoint. The real funnel lives inside WhatsApp. Optimize every WhatsApp touchpoint.

5. **Social proof compounds.** Every case study makes the next sale easier. Invest heavily in documenting results from Months 1-3.

6. **Pricing anchors to value, not competition.** Tikso is not competing with R$49 scheduling tools. Tikso replaces a R$2,000/month receptionist. Price accordingly.

7. **Community creates moat.** A community of 500 barbershop/salon owners sharing tips and wins is a competitive advantage no competitor can copy.
