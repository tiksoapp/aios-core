## Competitive Visual Landscape

Before designing, here is the competitive positioning map. The goal is to occupy **uncontested visual territory**.

| Competitor | Primary Color | Style | Logo Type | Visual Territory |
|------------|--------------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Kommo | Deep Purple (#6C3EBF) | Geometric, cut "K" | Wordmark + icon | Modern/Enterprise |
| Respond.io | Royal Blue (#1A56DB) | Clean, square icon | Icon + wordmark | Enterprise/Corporate |
| BotConversa | Green (#2ECC71) | Playful, rounded | Icon + wordmark | Accessible/Friendly |
| AwSales | Dark (#1A1A2E) + accent | Premium, dark-first | Wordmark | Premium/Dark |
| Chatfuel | Orange-Red | Energetic, bold | Icon + wordmark | Energetic/Startup |

**White space opportunity:** The intersection of **warm technology + approachable intelligence** is unoccupied. No competitor owns teal/coral/amber territory. No competitor successfully conveys "AI that feels human" visually.

---

## Concept 1 -- The Pulse Mark

### Racional

"Tikso" sounds like a heartbeat -- a tick, a pulse. This concept builds on that phonetic energy. The icon is a stylized **pulse/heartbeat line** that forms the letter **T**, representing the living, breathing nature of the AI (Eli) that never sleeps. It says: "your business has a heartbeat, even when you are not there."

The pulse line has a single peak (like a cardiogram) that doubles as the vertical stroke of the T, with the crossbar extending naturally from the pulse baseline. This creates immediate recognition at any size.

### Visual Representation

  +----------------+
```

### Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| Primary | Teal Pulse | `#0D9488` | Logo mark, primary actions, key UI elements |
| Primary Dark | Deep Teal | `#0F766E` | Hover states, dark mode primary |
| Secondary | Warm Coral | `#F97066` | Accent, notifications, pulse animation |
| Neutral Dark | Charcoal | `#1E293B` | Text on light backgrounds, dark mode BG |
| Neutral Light | Cloud | `#F8FAFC` | Light backgrounds, cards |
| Neutral Mid | Slate | `#64748B` | Secondary text, borders |

**Rationale:** Teal bridges technology (blue) and growth (green), while coral provides the warmth and humanity. Together they create a "living technology" feel that no competitor occupies.

### Typography

| Role | Font | Weight | Google Fonts |
|------|------|--------|--------------|
| Logo wordmark | **DM Sans** | Bold (700) | [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans) |
| Headings | **DM Sans** | SemiBold (600) | Same family |
| Body | **Inter** | Regular (400) | [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) |

**Why DM Sans:** Geometric precision with just enough softness in the curves. The lowercase "k" in DM Sans has a distinctive diagonal that gives "tikso" visual rhythm without needing custom modifications. Clean at all sizes.

### Favicon/App Icon Behavior

The Pulse-T icon works standalone in a rounded square container. At 16x16 (favicon), the pulse simplifies to just the peak and the T stroke -- still recognizable. Background: Teal Pulse (`#0D9488`). Mark: White (`#FFFFFF`).

---

## Concept 2 -- The Tik Link

### Racional

This concept focuses on **connection** -- the core value of a CRM. The icon is formed by two shapes that interlock: a **T** and a speech bubble fragment that click together like puzzle pieces. The name "Tik" evokes a checkmark, a confirmation, a "done" -- so the design subtly incorporates a checkmark motion in the negative space where the two shapes meet.

The message: "conversations that connect, tasks that get done."

### Visual Representation

```
  ICON (The Tik Link):

  +------+
  |  T   |----+
  |      |    |
  +--+   | .. |
     |   +----+
     |
     +

  The T-block and the speech fragment interlock.
  The negative space between them suggests a checkmark.

  Simplified view:

  |    |            |
  |    +            |
  +----------------+
```

### Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| Primary | Electric Indigo | `#6366F1` | Logo mark, primary actions |
| Primary Dark | Deep Indigo | `#4F46E5` | Hover states, dark mode primary |
| Secondary | Amber Glow | `#F59E0B` | Accent, success states, warmth |
| Neutral Dark | Ink | `#0F172A` | Text, dark mode backgrounds |
| Neutral Light | Snow | `#F9FAFB` | Light backgrounds |
| Neutral Mid | Stone | `#6B7280` | Secondary text |

**Rationale:** Indigo is close to Kommo's purple territory but distinctly bluer and more electric -- it reads as "intelligent" rather than "corporate." Amber provides the Brazilian warmth and optimism, creating a unique indigo-amber pairing that none of the competitors use.

### Typography

| Role | Font | Weight | Google Fonts |
|------|------|--------|--------------|
| Logo wordmark | **Exo 2** | Bold (700) | [Exo 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo+2) |
| Headings | **Exo 2** | SemiBold (600) | Same family |
| Body | **Inter** | Regular (400) | [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) |

**Why Exo 2:** Futuristic-geometric with a tech DNA. The "k" in Exo 2 has sharp, confident angles. The "t" has a distinctive crossbar. Together "tikso" in Exo 2 reads as modern and purposeful. Still highly legible at small sizes.

### Favicon/App Icon Behavior

The interlocking T + speech-bubble icon works well in a rounded square. At small sizes, simplify to just the T-block and dot fragment. Background: Electric Indigo (`#6366F1`). Mark: White + Amber dot (`#F59E0B`).

---

## Concept 3 -- The Folded T

### Racional

This is the boldest and most distinctive concept. The icon is a single letter **T** with its right arm folded down, creating a shape that simultaneously reads as:

1. A **T** for Tikso
2. A **speech bracket** (like quotation marks or a chat indicator)
3. A **forward arrow** suggesting momentum and efficiency

The fold is the key design move -- it transforms a generic letter into a proprietary shape. It is ownable, memorable, and works at every scale from billboard to favicon. This is the "Draplin approach" -- one bold shape, no fuss, no gradients, pure mark.

### Visual Representation

```
  ICON (The Folded T):

  _________
  ___| T |___
     |   |
     |   \
     |    \
     |     |
     |_____|

  The right arm of the T folds downward,
  creating a bracket/arrow hybrid.

  Clean version:

   __|__

     |  |
     |_/

  Even cleaner (favicon-ready):

  |      |__/      |

```

### Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| Primary | Ocean Blue | `#0EA5E9` | Logo mark, primary actions |
| Primary Dark | Deep Ocean | `#0284C7` | Hover states, dark mode primary |
| Secondary | Lime Spark | `#84CC16` | Accent, success, growth indicators |
| Neutral Dark | Obsidian | `#18181B` | Text, dark mode backgrounds |
| Neutral Light | Pearl | `#FAFAFA` | Light backgrounds |
| Neutral Mid | Zinc | `#71717A` | Secondary text, borders |

**Rationale:** Ocean blue is universally trusted (tech, finance, reliability) but the specific shade chosen is brighter and more energetic than Respond.io's corporate blue. Lime green as secondary injects freshness and growth -- perfect for a Brazilian audience that associates green with progress and nature. The combination feels like "a tech product made by humans who care."

### Typography

| Role | Font | Weight | Google Fonts |
|------|------|--------|--------------|
| Logo wordmark | **Poppins** | Bold (700) | [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) |
| Headings | **Poppins** | SemiBold (600) | Same family |
| Body | **DM Sans** | Regular (400) | [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans) |

**Why Poppins:** Geometric circles and friendly curves. The "t" in Poppins has a rounded terminal that echoes the fold in the icon. The "k" has clean, balanced diagonals. "tikso" in Poppins feels approachable and modern -- exactly the "tech-forward but not intimidating" brief requirement.

### Favicon/App Icon Behavior

The Folded T is the strongest favicon performer of all three concepts. Its bold, simple geometry survives 16x16 perfectly. Background: Ocean Blue (`#0EA5E9`). Mark: White (`#FFFFFF`).

## Recommendation

### Preferred: Concept 1 -- The Pulse Mark

**Why this is the strongest direction:**

1. **Uniqueness:** No CRM competitor uses a heartbeat/pulse motif. It is immediately ownable territory.

2. **Semantic depth:** The pulse simultaneously communicates "alive" (your AI never sleeps), "reliable" (like a heartbeat, always there), and "efficient" (tick-tock, things get done on time). These are exactly Tikso's core value propositions.

3. **Phonetic alignment:** "Tikso" sounds rhythmic, percussive -- like a heartbeat. The visual reinforces the audio of the name. This creates multi-sensory brand coherence.

4. **Scalability:** The pulse-T icon works perfectly from 16px favicon to billboard. It simplifies gracefully. The mark can animate (pulse animation on loading screens) without looking gimmicky.

5. **Color differentiation:** Teal + Coral is completely unoccupied in the CRM/chatbot competitive landscape. It reads as "tech that cares" -- exactly the positioning gap identified.

6. **Typography:** DM Sans for the wordmark + Inter for body text is a proven, highly legible pairing that works across Brazilian Portuguese (with accents and cedilhas) at all sizes.

**Second choice:** Concept 3 (The Folded T) if the team wants maximum boldness and simplicity. The Draplin-style single-shape approach is extremely strong for brand recognition, but requires more confidence in the mark alone to carry meaning.

**Third choice:** Concept 2 (The Tik Link) is solid but runs the closest risk of feeling like "another SaaS logo" with the interlocking shapes pattern.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Select concept** -- team reviews and picks a direction (or requests refinements)
2. **Refinement round** -- selected concept gets detailed vector specifications
3. **Design system handoff** -- route to @brad-frost for full design system implementation with tokens based on the selected palette
4. **Asset production** -- SVG, PNG (1x, 2x, 3x), ICO, and color variants (full color, white, dark)
5. **Implementation** -- Tailwind config with brand colors, font imports, component library

---

## HANDOFF NOTES

```
## HANDOFF: @aaron-draplin -> @brad-frost (pending concept approval)

**Project:** Tikso Brand Identity
**Phase Completed:** Logo Concept Development (3 directions)

**Deliverables Transferred:**
- 3 logo concepts with rationale
- Color palettes with hex codes
- Typography selections (Google Fonts)
- Usage guidelines
- Application mockups

**Context for Next Phase:**
- Once a concept is approved, @brad-frost takes the palette and typography
  to build Tailwind CSS tokens and a component system
- Dark mode support is a requirement
- The product uses Next.js + Tailwind CSS (see tech-preferences.md)

**Success Criteria:**
- Design tokens that match the approved palette exactly
- Dark/light mode switching built into the token system
- Component library foundations (buttons, inputs, cards) using brand colors
```
