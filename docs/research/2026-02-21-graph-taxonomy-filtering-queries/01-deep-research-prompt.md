# Deep Research Prompt

## Decomposed Sub-Queries

6 parallel Haiku workers dispatched:

### Worker 1: Entity Taxonomy
"Entity taxonomy best practices developer tool dependency graphs categories subcategories tagging hierarchical classification codebase entities"

### Worker 2: Accessible Color Palettes
"Accessible color palette design 10+ categories data visualization WCAG compliant dark theme graph nodes distinguishable colors"

### Worker 3: vis-network Filtering UI
"vis-network JavaScript filtering UI sidebar search category toggles large graphs 500+ nodes interactive filter"

### Worker 4: vis-network Clustering & Performance
"vis-network clustering grouping collapsible categories performance optimization 500+ nodes large graph rendering"

### Worker 5: JavaScript Graph Query API
"JavaScript graph query API traversal path finding impact analysis dependency graph library programmatic queries"

### Worker 6: Code Intelligence Integration
"Code intelligence context engine consuming dependency graph data programmatically AI agent codebase awareness graph-based context"

## Search Strategy

- Parallel execution of all 6 workers
- Tools: WebSearch + WebFetch
- Max 3 deep reads per worker
- Single wave (coverage sufficient)
