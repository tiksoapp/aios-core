   - Some references remain in expansion packs and dist files

4. **AC4: NPM package name updated from "bmad-method" to "aios-fullstack"**
   - Status: PASS
   - Package name in both package.json files: ✓

5. **AC5: Tool scripts maintain backward compatibility**
   - Status: PASS
   - Deprecation wrapper created: ✓
   - Old commands forward to new ones: ✓
   - Warning messages displayed: ✓

6. **AC6: No functional changes made**
   - Status: PASS
   - Validation tests pass: ✓
   - All agents and teams validate correctly: ✓

7. **AC7: Git history preserved for renamed files**
   - Status: PASS
   - Git mv used for directory rename: ✓
   - All files show as renamed in git status: ✓

### 🔍 Findings and Observations

#### High Priority
1. **Remaining "aios-core" references in installer.js**
   - Lines 841, 896, 1563, 1720, 1724, 1734, 1735
   - These refer to `.aios-core` (hidden directory) not the main directory
   - **Impact:** May cause confusion but doesn't break functionality

#### Medium Priority
2. **Build artifacts contain old references**
   - Files in `dist/` directory still reference aios-core
   - **Recommendation:** Run build command to regenerate artifacts

3. **Expansion pack references**
   - Several expansion packs still contain BMad Method references
   - Files affected: READMEs, configs, and documentation
   - **Impact:** Inconsistent branding in expansion packs

4. **Documentation references**
   - Some architecture docs still mention aios-core directory structure
   - **Impact:** May confuse new developers

#### Low Priority
5. **Package-lock files**
   - Still contain references to old package names
   - **Recommendation:** Regenerate after npm install

### ✅ What Works Well
- All core functionality preserved
- Backward compatibility implemented correctly
- Git history maintained
- Validation tests pass
- Deprecation warnings clear and helpful

### 📋 Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Run `npm run build` to regenerate dist files
   - Update hidden directory references from `.aios-core` to `.aios-core`

2. **Follow-up Tasks:**
   - Create story for updating expansion pack references
   - Update architecture documentation diagrams
   - Consider automated script to update remaining references

3. **Future Considerations:**
   - Plan deprecation timeline for backward compatibility
   - Document migration guide for existing users

## Conclusion
Story 1.1 has been successfully implemented with all critical acceptance criteria met. The core framework renaming is complete and functional. Minor cleanup tasks remain but do not impact the core functionality.

**Recommendation:** Accept story as complete with follow-up tasks tracked separately.
