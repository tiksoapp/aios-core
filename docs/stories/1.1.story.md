# Story 1.1: Rename Core Framework Files

## Status
completed

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** to rename all core framework files and references from AIOS-Method to AIOS-FULLSTACK,
**so that** the new branding is consistently applied throughout the framework foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All references to "bmad-method" in package.json files are renamed to "aios-fullstack"
2. The main directory "aios-core" is renamed to "aios-core"
3. All references to "BMad Method" or "BMAD-METHOD" in documentation files are updated to "AIOS-FULLSTACK"
4. The npm package name is updated from "bmad-method" to "aios-fullstack"
5. All tool scripts maintain backward compatibility with existing projects during transition
6. No functional changes are made - only naming/branding updates
7. Git history is preserved for all renamed files

## Dev Notes

### CRITICAL: Working Directory
**All operations in this story must be executed from the project root directory:**
`C:\Users\AllFluence-User\Workspaces\Alephant\aios-fullstack\aios-fullstack\`

This is where the main package.json and aios-core directory are located.

### Project Structure Reference
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#estrutura-de-diretrios-do-projeto]

Current structure shows:
```
aios-fullstack/         # Project root - work from here
├── aios-core/          # To be renamed to aios-core
├── tools/
│   ├── installer/
│   └── builders/
├── docs/
└── package.json        # Main package file
```

### File Paths Requiring Updates
Based on current project structure, these paths need updating:
- All files in tools/ directory that reference aios-core paths
- Package.json files at root and in tools/installer/
- Documentation files in docs/ directory
- The bmad-npx-wrapper.js for CLI commands

### Testing Requirements
[Source: No specific testing strategy found in architecture docs]

Since no specific testing framework is defined in architecture docs, follow standard practices:
- Ensure all existing functionality works after renaming
- Test backward compatibility features
- Verify git history preservation

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#pilha-de-tecnologia-atual]
- Runtime: Node.js >=20.0.0
- Package Manager: npm
- Key Dependencies: inquirer, fs-extra, js-yaml

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story (1.1) of the project.

## Testing
- Test file location: No specific test directory found in architecture
- Test standards: Ensure backward compatibility and no functional changes
- Testing frameworks: No specific framework defined in architecture docs
- Story-specific requirements: Test that all rename operations preserve functionality
