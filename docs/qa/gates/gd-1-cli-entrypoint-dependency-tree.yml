    notes: 'No user input in shell commands. No file writes. No network requests from module. process.exit is only side effect.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Registry with 517 entities renders instantly. Caching with configurable TTL prevents redundant loads.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Three-level fallback: code-intel → registry → empty graph. All failure modes produce valid output.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation (data-source → renderer → CLI). JSDoc on all public functions. Follows existing code-intel patterns.'
