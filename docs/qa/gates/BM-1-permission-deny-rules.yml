story_title: Permission Deny Rules & Toggleable Config
gate: PASS
status_reason: >
  All 11 ACs met. Deny rules correctly protect L1/L2 paths, allow rules permit
  L3/L4 exceptions. Toggleable config documented in core-config.yaml.
  CONCERN-1 (gitignore) resolved: .claude pattern changed from '.claude' to
  '.claude/*' with '!.claude/settings.json' exception added.
